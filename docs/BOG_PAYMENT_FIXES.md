# BOG Payment System Fixes - October 17, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ getUserPayments 500 Error
**Problem**: GET /api/bog/payments was returning 500 Internal Server Error

**Root Causes**:
- Query tried to select non-existent columns (`name_ka`, `name_en`, `name_ru`)
- Product names are stored in translations table (Astrotomic Translatable)
- Missing error handling for empty products relationship
- Unsafe access to pivot data when no products attached

**Solutions Applied**:
- Removed column selection from products eager loading query
- Added proper translation loading using `translate()` method
- Wrapped product transformation in try-catch blocks
- Added null checks for products relationship and pivot data
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging

**Files Modified**:
- `app/Http/Controllers/Website/BogPaymentController.php`
  - Updated `getUserPayments()` method (lines ~950-1020)
  - Fixed products eager loading query
  - Added translation handling for product names
  - Added error handling for missing products/pivot data

### 2. ✅ Created Missing bulk-rental-status Endpoint
**Problem**: POST /api/products/bulk-rental-status returned 405 Method Not Allowed

**Root Cause**: Endpoint didn't exist - frontend was calling it as fallback when getUserPayments failed

**Solution**: Created new endpoint to bulk update product rental status

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `app/Http/Controllers/Website/BogPaymentController.php`
  - Added `bulkUpdateRentalStatus()` method
  - Validates product IDs, rental dates
  - Updates products table: is_ordered, ordered_by, is_rented, rental dates
  - Returns detailed success/failure report for each product
  
- `routes/website/products.php`
  - Added POST route: `/api/products/bulk-rental-status`
  - Requires `auth:sanctum` middleware
  - Maps to `BogPaymentController::bulkUpdateRentalStatus`

- `docs/API_BULK_RENTAL_STATUS.md`
  - Complete API documentation
  - Request/response examples
  - Usage examples in JavaScript/TypeScript and cURL

### 3. ✅ Enhanced Logging
**Added Logging For**:
- getUserPayments calls (user ID, result count)
- BOG payWithSavedCard API responses
- BOG API failures
- Product rental status updates
- Database errors

**Files Modified**:
- `app/Http/Controllers/Website/BogPaymentController.php`
  - Added logging in `getUserPayments()` method
  - Added logging in `payWithSavedCard()` method
  - Enhanced error logging throughout

## API Endpoint Summary

### GET /api/bog/payments
**Status**: ✅ Fixed
- Returns user's payment history with products
- Handles missing products gracefully
- Uses proper translation loading for product names
- No longer crashes on empty pivot tables

### POST /api/products/bulk-rental-status
**Status**: ✅ Created
- Bulk updates product rental status
- Requires authentication (Sanctum)
- Validates all inputs
- Returns detailed success/failure report
- Logs all updates for debugging

## Database Schema Notes

### Products Table
- Uses Astrotomic Translatable for multilingual fields
- `name` is stored in `product_translations` table
- Columns: id, price, color, size, rental_period, is_ordered, ordered_by, is_rented, rented_by, etc.
- `rented_by` has FK to `users` table (NOT `web_users`)

### BOG Payments Table
- Columns: id, bog_order_id, user_id, amount, status, request_payload, etc.
- `request_payload` is JSON field storing basket and web_user_id
- `user_id` has FK to `users` table (problematic with web_users)

### Pivot Table: bog_payment_product
- Links payments to products
- Columns: bog_payment_id, product_id, quantity, unit_price, total_price
- Currently empty in local database (no test data)

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Completed Tests
1. Verified route registration
2. Verified query syntax (JSON_EXTRACT works)
3. Verified Product model uses Translatable
4. Added error handling for missing relationships
5. Created comprehensive API documentation

### ⚠️ Pending Tests (Need Production Access)
1. Test getUserPayments with real user data
2. Test bulkUpdateRentalStatus with real products
3. Verify saved card payments create DB records
4. Check BOG API responses in production logs
5. Verify products are attached to payments in pivot table

## Frontend Integration Notes

### Current Frontend Behavior
1. User completes saved card payment
2. Frontend receives response (shows payment_id: 31)
3. Frontend calls GET /api/bog/payments ❌ (was failing, now fixed)
4. Frontend falls back to POST /api/products/bulk-rental-status ✅ (now exists)

### Recommended Frontend Flow
1. User completes payment
2. Wait for BOG callback to process (backend marks products automatically)
3. Call GET /api/bog/payments to show order history
4. Only call bulk-rental-status if backend didn't mark products

## Known Issues Still to Investigate

### 1. Saved Card Payments Not Creating DB Records
**Symptoms**:
- Frontend shows payment_id: 31
- No payment exists in database
- No logs in local Laravel logs

**Likely Causes**:
- Frontend testing against production (admin.momtabare.com)
- Local database doesn't have production data
- payment_id: 31 exists in production database

**Solution**: Need to check production server logs at admin.momtabare.com

### 2. Empty Pivot Table
**Symptoms**:
- bog_payment_product table is empty
- Test payments exist but have no products attached

**Likely Causes**:
- Test payments were created without basket data
- Products were not attached in payWithSavedCard
- Pivot table creation code not being reached

**Solution**: Need to test complete payment flow with basket data

## Commands Used

```bash
# Clear caches
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan route:clear

# Verify route registration
php artisan route:list --name=bulk-rental-status

# Check database
# (via Laravel Boost MCP tools)
```

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Production**:
   - Push changes to production server
   - Clear production caches
   - Test with real payment flow

2. **Monitor Logs**:
   - Check for "getUserPayments called" logs
   - Check for "BOG payWithSavedCard API response" logs
   - Look for any new error messages

3. **Test Complete Flow**:
   - Create test payment with saved card
   - Verify payment record is created in DB
   - Verify products are attached to payment
   - Verify getUserPayments returns correct data
   - Verify bulk-rental-status works as fallback

4. **Frontend Updates** (Optional):
   - Update error handling to use new detailed responses
   - Add retry logic if getUserPayments fails
   - Show user-friendly error messages
   - Remove bulk-rental-status call if getUserPayments succeeds
