## 📦 What You Need to Add

Since controllers depend heavily on your application structure (like WebUser, Product models), they should remain in your application. However, you can easily create controllers that use the package services.

### Example Controller Usage

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Bog\Payment\Services\BogAuthService;
use Bog\Payment\Services\BogPaymentService;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class PaymentController extends Controller
{
    protected $bogAuth;
    protected $bogPayment;

    public function __construct(BogAuthService $bogAuth, BogPaymentService $bogPayment)
    {
        $this->bogAuth = $bogAuth;
        $this->bogPayment = $bogPayment;
    }

    public function createOrder(Request $request)
    {
        $token = $this->bogAuth->getAccessToken();
        
        $result = $this->bogPayment->createOrder($token['access_token'], $request->all());
        
        return response()->json($result);
    }
}
```
